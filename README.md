# Java_Course
I have created a console-based mini project called as "Guess the Number" game using Java programming. I have used basic concepts of oops such as class and object & conditional statements and operators.

In this game, there are four classes:

~ Guesser class -> a guesser choose or guesses a number.

~ Player class-> different players guess a number.

~ Umpire class -> umpire compares the player's number with the guesser and announces the winner.

~ Main class-> To access the Umpire class method, and get the winner of the game.
